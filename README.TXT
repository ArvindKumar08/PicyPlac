PROJECT TITLE:PicyPlac
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To Demonstrate my Java Capabilities to Stack Builders Ecuador
VERSION or DATE:1
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Run Using BLUEJ 
AUTHORS:Arvind Kumar
USER INSTRUCTIONS:


Once Run using BLUEJ:

1. Please right click on PicyPlac Class
2. Select new PicyPlac() on the menu



This software is limited by its nature. I was not able to do the plate recognition within 72 hours but I was able to let the user upload a plate number. The user can input the plate number and I believe that with a few more tweaks, the system would be able to tell if the car is legal to drive or not. 

I hope for your patience and understanding as this was really made in a rush but I was able to demonstrate my JAVA skills. 

If You have any comments or suggestions, please feel free to do so!

Thanks.
